# esvcsCode
This respository holds the code for my esvcs project. The repository structure follows 
"gitflow" (I think).

The main branch holds fully functional code. If I discover a coding error that affects main, it will be fixed in a hotfix branch that will then be pulled into the other branches.
Most coding occurs in the development branch or feature branches off of that.
